As the user storage / identity management we will use the open source
[ORY Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos) project. The React Native application
shown in the screens below is available on at
[github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native)
as well. Both are maintained by [@aeneasr](https://github.com/aeneasr) and

You can download the app right now from the
[Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fj/app/ory-profile-app/id1536546333)
and
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ory.kratos_self_service_ui_react_native)!

In the future, this guide will also cover Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA/MFA),
"Sign in with Google", password reset, email verification, phone number and SMS
verification, "Sign in with GitHub", "Sign in with Facebook" and many other
flows.

## Auth, Login, Registration, User Management React Native Template for Expo

This guide assumes that you have worked with React and React Native before as we
will not cover React fundamentals and focus on implementing login, registration
and so on.

To make things a bit easier, we will use [`expo`](https://expo.io). At a
minimum, you need NodeJS and NPM installed locally. We will use the ORY Kratos
React Native Login, Registration and Profile Management template:

```shell-session
$ npm install -g expo-cli
$ expo init login-signup-app -t @oryd/expo-login-registration-template --npm

# We also want to install and initialize all required components:
$ cd login-signup-app
~/login-signup-app$ npm i
~/login-signup-app$ npm run expo-install
# For iOS you also need to run:
~/login-signup-app$ npm run pod-install
```

In case you want to just start exploring, simply run:

- `npm start` opens a dashboard where you can open iOS, Android, or web.
- `npm run android` opens the app as an android app (requires a connected
  android VM or device).
- `npm run ios` opens the app in the iOS simulator (works only on mac OSX).
- `npm run web` opens the app as a browser app.

![Expo CLI Dashboard for ORY Kratos React Native Reference Implementation](../../images/articles/react-native/expo-dashboard.png)

Running these commands directly will use our hosted demo environment of ORY
Kratos at
[demo.tenants.staging.oryapis.dev](https://demo.tenants.staging.oryapis.dev).
Configure this in `app.config.js`:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/app.config.js"
/>

:::info

Please be aware that the demo environment including its admin APIs is available
to everyone. Use only anonymised data when playing around with it! If you want
your own managed environment reach out to [jared@ory.sh](mailto:jared@ory.sh) or
set up your own open source environment. Information on achieving that is
available in part two of this article.

</p>

## User Management / Identity Management

To manage identities, you may use the ORY Kratos CLI. An overview of all
commands can be found in the
[ORY Kratos documentation](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/cli/kratos) or by
running:

```shell session
$ docker run oryd/kratos:v0.5.4-alpha.1 help
```

To list all identities in the system, run:

```shell-session
$ docker run oryd/kratos:v0.5.4-alpha.1 \
  --endpoint https://demo.tenants.staging.oryapis.dev/api/kratos/admin \
  identities list

ID					VERIFIED ADDRESS 1		RECOVERY ADDRESS 1		SCHEMA ID	SCHEMA URL
f9c33e56-5b43-458a-8cfa-f38a4fb98b9c	office+demo@ory.sh		office+demo@ory.sh		default		https://demo.tenants.staging.oryapis.dev/api/kratos/public/schemas/default
[...]
```

You can also search for the identity you just signed up using `jq`:

```shell-session
$ yourEmail=<the-email-you-used-for-signup>
# For example:
#   yourEmail=office+demo@ory.sh
$ docker run oryd/kratos:v0.5.4-alpha.1 \
  --endpoint https://demo.tenants.staging.oryapis.dev/api/kratos/admin \
  identities list -f json | \
    jq '.[] | select(.traits.email == "'$yourEmail'")'

{
  "id": "f9c33e56-5b43-458a-8cfa-f38a4fb98b9c",
  "recovery_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "bd7c396c-d893-4a2b-8627-b50aa38e2569",
      "value": "office+demo@ory.sh",
      "via": "email"
    }
  ],
  "schema_id": "default",
  "schema_url": "https://demo.tenants.staging.oryapis.dev/api/kratos/public/schemas/default",
  "traits": {
    "email": "office+demo@ory.sh",
    "name": {
      "first": "Aeneas",
      "last": "Hackerman"
    }
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "bee9b276-b57f-41dc-8c61-82eb83c2d4fd",
      "status": "completed",
      "value": "office+demo@ory.sh",
      "verified": true,
      "verified_at": "2020-11-26T08:45:22.094Z",
      "via": "email"
    }
  ]
}
```

[Managing Users and Identities Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/admin/managing-users-identities)!

## Run ORY Kratos Login, Registration, 2FA Server Locally in Docker

Instead of using the hosted demo environment, you can also deploy your own ORY
Kratos installation locally and run the React Native app against its API. To run
the app against a local deployment, check out
[ORY Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos) locally and run the quickstart:

```shell-session
# You might want to cd into another directory:
# $ cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/ory/kratos.git
$ cd kratos
$ git checkout v0.5.4-alpha.1
$ docker-compose -f quickstart.yml -f quickstart-standalone.yml \
    up --build --force-recreate -d
```

Next you need to set up port forwarding for the ORY Kratos Docker Image you just
started. We use the tool [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com).

```shell-session
$ ngrok http 4433

Account                       ...
Version                       ...
Region                        ...
Web Interface                 ...
Forwarding                    ...
Forwarding                    https://04ee3e08367a.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:4433

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL (example from above
`https://04ee3e08367a.ngrok.io`) and in a new terminal, set it as an environment
variable and start the app:

```shell-session
# Change into the directory of your react native app:
$ cd login-signup-app
$ KRATOS_URL=<the-ngrok-url> npm start
# For example:
# $ KRATOS_URL=https://04ee3e08367a.ngrok.io npm start
```

Now your app will use the local deployment of ORY Kratos with your own database!

## React Native Navigation with Authentication Session

The entrypoint for the app is
[`App.tsx`](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/App.tsx).
Besides loading some fonts and setting up the views, this component includes the
structure of the application - including the navigation:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="export default"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/App.tsx"
/>

The most interesting component here is the `<AuthProvider>`. This component adds
an authentication / login context to the React Native component tree:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="export default"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/AuthProvider.tsx"
/>

The helper methods in
[`src/helpers/auth.tsx`](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/auth.tsx)
are simple wrappers around Expo's
[SecureStore](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/). In order
to work on the web as well, we use
[`@react-native-community/async-storage`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage)
as a fallback:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="// getAuthenticatedSession"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/auth.tsx"
/>

That's all it takes to make the magic happen! Everything else is handled by The
[ORY Kratos' Session Token](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/guides/login-session)
handles everything else.

We now have a place to store and refresh the user session. In addition, we have
a way to see if the user session is still active in the navigation and show the
dashboard or login / registration screens:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="export default"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Navigation.tsx"
/>

## React Native Screens

Let's take a look at the different screens: In order for us to not write a form
renderer for every component - including styling - we abstracted the form
rendering into their own components, which you can find in
[`src/components/Form`](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/tree/master/src/components/Form).

There isn't anything special happening there, but you can have a look if you
intend to change the layout for example.

### Login Navigation Component

The User Login component uses the ORY Kratos TypeScript SDK and the
[User Login API Flow](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-login).

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="const Login ="
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Routes/Login.tsx"
/>

### Registration Navigation Component

The User Registration component performs a
[User Registration API Flow](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-registration).

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="const Registration ="
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Routes/Registration.tsx"
/>

### Home Navigation Component

The Home component receives the user's authentication session and displays all
relevant information. To learn more about ORY Kratos' Identity and User
Management check out the
[ORY Kratos Identity Data Model](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/identity-data-model).

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="const Home ="
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Routes/Home.tsx"
/>

### Settings Navigation Component

The User Settings component performs a
[User Settings API Flow](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-settings).

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  startAt="const Settings ="
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Routes/Settings.tsx"
/>

## Writing Login and Registration for a React Native App From Scratch

Granted, using a template is the easiest way to get started. However,
understanding how everything works is better. Let's have a look at the project
set up process!

Assuming that you ran `expo init` with one of the default templates:

```shell-session
$ expo init login-signup-app --npm
$ cd login-signup-app
```

### React Native Navigation

To set up screen navigation, we use the standard React Native navigation
component:

```shell-session
$ npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
$ expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

### React Native / Expo Encrypted Credentials Storage

We will use
[`expo-secure-store`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) to
securely store the user's session key in the encrypted device store (Android
Keystore / Expo Secure Store). To install it we need to run:

```shell-session
$ expo install expo-secure-store @react-native-community/async-storage
# For iOS you also need to run:
$ npx pod-install
```

We're also adding `@react-native-community/async-storage` because
`expo-secure-store` does not work on the Web.

### ORY Kratos SDKs for React Native

We also need to install the ORY Kratos SDK. We'll also be making sure the app
looks beautiful by installing the ORY Themes package and some fonts later.

```shell-session
# The package "url" is needed as it is not natively available in React Native.
$ npm install @oryd/kratos-client@0.5.4-alpha.1 url
```

### React Native Environment Variable Support

Next we want to set up support for environment variables which we will be using
in the next section. You can either
[follow the Expo guide on Environment Variables](https://docs.expo.io/guides/environment-variables/#using-babel-to-replace-variables)
or do the following:

```shell-session
$ expo install expo-constants
```

Create a file called `app.config.js` in the project's root:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/app.config.js"
/>

You can use this variable when initializing the ORY Kratos SDK:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/sdk.tsx"
/>

### Fonts and Other Dependencies

To make things a bit prettier, we are going to add the
[ORY Theme](https://github.com/ory/themes) and some fonts:

```shell-session
$ npm install @oryd/themes styled-components
$ expo install expo font @expo-google-fonts/rubik \
    @expo-google-fonts/roboto expo-status-bar
```

You are of course free to use your own themes here but for the sake of
completeness we added this to the guide.

### Conclusion

We have now implemented ORY Kratos Login, Registration and 2FA Server in React
Native!
