**What is Ory?**

Ory is an open-source software company dedicated to simplifying zero trust
cloud security for application developers by providing a specialized cloud platform that
delivers authorization, authentication, ID management, and API protection. Ory uses these
open source products in its flagship Ory Cloud, which provides a low latency global scale
network.

Ory maintains numerous open-source software products in the area of zero-trust security. The
main products include Kratos for identity management, Hydra for Oauth2 and OIDC, Ory
Oathkeeper for reliable and scalable APIs, and Keto for authentication, authorization, access
control, and delegation. Ory's products focus on offering diverse options to easily set up and
manage identity platforms, authorization, authentication and all within one console.
Why Ory? Many developers struggle with the complexities of zero-trust security for cloud
computing. In order to reduce friction in onboarding customers, Ory offers endless features,
including identity management and authorization that can be set up for a company’s specific
needs. Managing customer-relevant information in a secure infrastructure separate from an
organisations’s application also has advantages for data privacy, regional compliance for
example GDPR, and increased security against data theft.

Ory’s mission is to provide a common access control, authorization and identity
infrastructure that manages IAM and the associated data created in cloud applications. Ory
helps its customers manage numerous aspects of data protection and data complexity through
its multi-cloud and multi-region architecture. Ory’s open source community has already
reached tens of thousands of people and projects including Blues Wireless, Segment, and
Coinbase. Ory’s founders are open source leaders with experience at SAP, Deutsche
Telekom, Microsoft and Deutsche Börse Group.

“The challenge facing most developers today is complexity. Building cloud software is a new
paradigm involving many evolving technologies. Ory simplifies zero trust security by putting
id management, authorisation, and access control into one cloud system that is globally
distributed and runs using on multiple clouds.”
