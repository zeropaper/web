### Working At Ory

Ory is an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical
skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and
make a significant impact on how data is managed and shared in the cloud and on
the internet.

We're looking for rocket-smart and talented engineers who bring fresh ideas from
all areas, including, distributed computing, large-scale system design,
networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, UI design and
mobile. The list of relevant areas goes on and is growing every day.

Ory's software engineers develop the next-generation cloud technologies and
infrastructure that change how billions of users connect to, manage, and
interact with information and one another. Ory products need to be able to
handle information, users, and data at a massive scale. We're looking for
talented engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas and can contribute to
pushing the boundaries at Ory.

As a software engineer, you will work on projects critical to Ory’s needs with
opportunities and that shape how the Ory business grows and evolves. SRE ensures
that Ory's services — both our critical internal and our user-facing systems
—have reliability, uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of
improvement. Additionally SRE’s will keep an ever-watchful eye on our systems
capacity and performance. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing
systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation.

As a key member of a small and versatile team, you design, test, deploy, and
maintain software solutions. You will specialize in building responsive and
elegant web applications that can be used and scaled to millions of users.

### What You'll Do

- Engage in and improve the whole life cycle of services — from inception and
  design through to deployment, operation and refinement.

- Support services before they go live through activities such as system design
  consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning,
  and launch reviews.

- Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability,
  latency, and overall system health.

- Scale systems through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing
  for changes that improve reliability and velocity.

- Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems.
